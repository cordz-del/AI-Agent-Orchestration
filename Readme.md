## Overview

This repository is designed to showcase a sophisticated AI agent that coordinates multiple sub-agents to handle complex tasks. It dynamically chains prompts, injects contextual memory, and combines outputs from various AI models (such as GPT-4 and Anthropic Claude) to deliver a consistent, empathetic, and actionable conversational experience.

## Features

- **Advanced Multi-Agent Coordination:**  
  Orchestrates several AI modules working in concert to deliver unified responses.

- **Dynamic Prompt Chaining:**  
  Combines responses from different sub-agents and refines final outputs using context-aware techniques.

- **Context Injection & Memory:**  
  Maintains conversation history and uses it to adjust responses dynamically for continuity and personalization.

- **Scalable Architecture:**  
  Built with production-grade practices, ensuring the system is scalable, robust, and ready for real-world applications.

- **Comprehensive Documentation:**  
  Detailed architectural diagrams and documentation explain system interactions, design decisions, and scalability strategies.

## Agent Architecture

The core of the system lies in its orchestration logic. The repository includes modules that:
- Manage the interaction flow between multiple AI components.
- Handle prompt chaining by sequentially combining the outputs of sub-agents.
- Maintain a conversation log to provide context in subsequent interactions.

## Dynamic Prompt Chaining

The system uses dynamic prompt chaining techniques to:
- Merge and refine outputs from various models.
- Inject relevant context into the prompt to reduce ambiguity.
- Adapt the conversation flow based on user input and previous interactions.

For example, an optimized prompt might be:
> "You are Amie, a compassionate SEL assistant. A user has just mentioned they feel anxious about an upcoming exam. Provide supportive advice that is both empathetic and actionable."

This prompt is built dynamically by combining static templates with real-time user context.

## Context Injection & Memory

Our system maintains a persistent conversation log (or memory) that:
- Stores previous messages and interactions.
- Injects this historical context into new prompts.
- Ensures the AI responses remain coherent and personalized throughout the conversation.
